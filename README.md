# Giflet

Giftlet is a silly React Native app that has one simple purpose:

## Display a full screen gif based on a keyword.

Anyone familar with the `/giphy` command in Slack should be familiar with the perfect feeling of expressing your current emotional state in a concise, silent gif.

Giftlet is designed to run fullscreen on a tablet. In my case, it sits next to my desk while I'm working to tell my coworkers I'm either looking for a distraction, or I'm trying to focus and they need to go away.

## Tech Details

- Built with React Native and Expo library. I was interested in the Expo workflow, especially the live development features, and the automated build steps.

- Integrates with Giphy API
